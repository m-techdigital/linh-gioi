# Linh Giới Online — Next Action

Last updated: `2026-09-05`

## Current focus

Post-login visual runtime hardening plus device-profile asset governance. Login has been upgraded to V3B-aligned runtime presentation, source-level post-login readability polish is implemented, and mobile/tablet/PC runtime asset profile budgets are now documented and validated. The standalone visual evidence harness now captures all seven screenshots, can continue in background, and auto-finishes the Unity Player after manifest completion so the operator should not need to click or close the player by hand. Character lobby usability, in-world HUD presentation, world hub scene readability, and desktop/tablet/mobile responsive evidence are now verified with fresh runtime screenshots. Login-to-character copy has been cleaned of player-facing dev wording, status chips now read correctly in runtime screenshots, the session menu/settings shell is responsive without tablet/mobile clipping, in-world interaction affordance now has stateful target labels, runtime asset size inventory is documented/validated, V3B runtime candidates now carry platform-specific Unity import profiles for Standalone/Android/iPhone, the in-world HUD is more compact/touch-oriented across desktop/tablet/mobile, the world hub ground now uses a lightweight procedural cultivation-platform texture instead of a debug-like grid, the login first screen now uses a V3B composition with a centered text logo/CTA cluster plus right-side Gate Keeper on desktop/tablet and a compact logo/CTA layout on mobile, the Character Hall now uses a V3B cultivator portrait with a mobile-specific two-zone lobby layout and lighter panel density, build-size budget reporting now separates Unity runtime payload from repository/reference/tooling weight, the visual evidence loop now writes PNG heuristics for checkpoint presence/dimensions/byte size/pixel variation/duplicate-frame detection, world-hub labels now show by guided state/proximity instead of cluttering the whole scene, the login CTA stack now uses a lighter dark-glass panel to reduce cyan/gold glare while retaining the V3B logo/button language, and the World Hub now has lightweight procedural grounding shadows under the player, interactables, target dummy, warning slime, Spirit Gate, and key props. The visual review script supports quick iteration modes so UI/world changes do not need to rerun every full source/server gate after a nearby full pass.

Autopilot operating rule: when a task or phase is truly closed by its required gates, continue to the next roadmap-valid task/phase instead of stopping at the phase boundary. Stop only for a real blocker, unavailable runtime/tooling, required owner decision, or frozen contract/protocol/schema/ADR change.

## Next task

`LGO-WORLD-RESPONSIVE-EVIDENCE-REFRESH-v1.0`

Refresh desktop/tablet/mobile visual evidence after the World Hub depth pass, then tune responsive layout only if screenshots show clipping, overlarge UI, or weak hierarchy. Do not import heavy art or add gameplay.

## Current blocker

No active blocker for source work. Visual runtime capture is currently available in this environment and has completed multiple consecutive rounds without manual player close.

Next allowed action: refresh responsive visual evidence and tune only visible layout issues. The visual evidence harness records explicit review checklist categories and machine-readable heuristics for every checkpoint under marker `LGO_VISUAL_RUNTIME_REVIEW_HEURISTICS_READY`; world-hub label responsiveness is tracked under `LGO_WORLD_HUB_PROP_LABEL_RESPONSIVE_READY`; login visual balance is tracked under `LGO_LOGIN_PANEL_VISUAL_BALANCE_READY`; Character Hall density is tracked under `LGO_CHARACTER_HALL_PANEL_DENSITY_READY`; World Hub depth layering is tracked under `LGO_WORLD_SCENE_DEPTH_LAYERING_READY`; the project still refuses to claim visual PASS from capture/build alone.

## Runtime evidence command

```bash
./tools/lgo_visual_runtime_review.sh
```

Fast UI/visual iteration command after nearby full gates are already green:

```bash
LGO_VISUAL_RUNTIME_SOURCE_GATES=fast \
LGO_VISUAL_RUNTIME_SERVER_BUILD=skip \
LGO_VISUAL_RUNTIME_CLEAR_UNITY_CACHE=0 \
./tools/lgo_visual_runtime_review.sh
```

Expected classifications:

- `PASS`
- `FIX_REQUIRED`
- `VISUAL_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT`
- `VIDEO_CAPTURE_BLOCKED_ENV`
- `RUNTIME_BLOCKED_ENV`

## Stop conditions

- A frozen contract/protocol/schema/ADR change is required.
- Unity/player tooling is unavailable or visual capture is blocked by environment.
- A gate fails and cannot be fixed within allowed paths.
- Owner product/art decision is required.
- No valid next action remains.

## Follow-up task after current task

`LGO-WORLD-SCENE-DEPTH-LAYERING-PASS-v1.0` is source-ready. Continue with responsive evidence refresh and fix any visible UI/world composition issue found by screenshots.

Recent visual passes improved scene depth, NPC staging, responsive HUD behavior, world staging density, label readability, and evidence review scoring without new gameplay or frozen-surface changes.
